# Power BI Artificial Intelligence (AI)
-----
It is crucial for data analysts to explore and visualize data to help their stakeholders gain effective insights quickly. Business demands have evolved from executives asking what, which and when something happened, to asking why it happened and what will occur in the future. AI is the answer and Power BI adopted AI for analysts and business decision-makers!

  * With categorical values, Key Influencers uses ML.NET to run logistic regression for categorical metrics, using the One-hot encoding, Replace missing value, and Normalize mean variance data transformations and the L-BFGS Logistic Regression algorithm. While in numerical values, Key Influencers uses ML.NET to run linear regression, using the same data transformations as the categorical key influencers and using the SDCA regression algorithm. On the other hand, the Top Segments uses ML.NET to run a decision tree, using Fast tree algorithms (categorical and numerical), to find interesting subgroups.  _[learn more](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet/customers/power-bi)_
